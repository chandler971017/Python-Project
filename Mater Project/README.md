# Overview of the codes
1. `Uniform_sampling.ipynb` spreads the initial states uniformly in a square area.
2. `Interception.ipynb` intercepts a diffusion process so that the initial states follows a Gaussian distribution. 
3. `Girsanov.ipynb` is devoted to the realization of Importance Sampling by Changing the drift according to the Girsanov Theorem, where the inverse of Radon-Nikodyn derivatives are used as sample weights.
